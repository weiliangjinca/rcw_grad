numpy doesn't function properly with MPI, because by default it's not
single threading. To set it single thread,

1. check configuration: numpy.show_config()
2. set the correponding one to 1 thread, before import numpy:

import os
os.environ["OMP_NUM_THREADS"] = "1" # export OMP_NUM_THREADS=1
os.environ["OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS"] = "1" # export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
os.environ["MKL_NUM_THREADS"] = "1" # export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
os.environ["VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS"] = "1" # export VECLIB_MAXIMUM_THREADS=1
os.environ["NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS"] = "1" # export NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=1
